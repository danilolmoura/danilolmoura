### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer with experience building APIs and web systems.

I feel comfortable working with technologies like Python, relational and non-relational databases, tests and cloud services, which I use to properly solve software development problems.

I'm self-motivated, communicative, resilient and I'm always trying to improve my technical and interpersonal skills and I like to use these skills to help people solve real and everyday problems.

Backend (Python, Flask, Django, Java)
Frontend (Javascript, Angular, React)
Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Google BIgQuery, ElasticSearch)
Infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services)
Other (Git, TDD, regular expressions, scrum, kanban)
